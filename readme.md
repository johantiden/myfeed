*myfeed* aggregates your news flows into a single feed.
There are many aggregators like this, but this one is mine. 

The difference to other aggregators is that the goal is to also include look & feel as well as functionality from the original sites via plugins.

Content should work like they do at the original site without an extra click to go to the site. For example, for reddit sources there should be a vote up/down button and a "Comments" button embedded directly.



This repo will mostly be a base for prototyping. In the future, plugins should be put in separate repos.
